My project to create a simple telegram bot using Python

Simple code with API. 
When writing in Telegram, you will be told to write one of three animals, such as a dog, a cat or a fox. After writing, you will receive a random photo in response, one of the above photos.

## API of these animals
---
- https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search
- https://random.dog/woof.json
- https://randomfox.ca/floof/

You can also use other APIs on different sites.
